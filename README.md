### Overview
Easy-Peasy Weather is an interactive weather visualization application developed using Java and executed in the Processing IDE. The app provides intuitive weather data visualization, temperature conversion, and city-specific weather forecasts to enhance user engagement through graphical representations and a user-friendly interface.

### Features
- **Weather Data Visualization**: Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions using dynamic icons and graphs.
- **City Selection**: Users can select from predefined locations to view tailored weather details.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Seamlessly switch between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **Graphical Forecasts**: Provides a 5-day weather forecast with interactive hover features for additional details.
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Displays visually appealing, city-specific backgrounds for an immersive experience.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Development Environment**: Processing IDE  
- **ControlP5 Library**: Used for creating dropdown menus and UI components.  
- **Graphical Enhancements**: Leveraged depth maps generated using Stable Diffusion and Shader Maps for optimization in Blender.  

### Key Functionality
- **Data Generation**: Utilizes a random number generator to simulate weather data (temperature, humidity, and conditions).  
- **Temperature Converter**: Enables real-time toggling between temperature units through a user-friendly GUI.  
- **Dynamic Weather Icons**: Icons sourced from Flaticon to represent conditions like sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy.  
- **Interactive Graphs**: Forecasts are displayed through colorful, interactive graphs with hover details.
